# 🌊 DWLR Water Level Alert System
A software application for analyzing DWLR (Digital Water Level Recorder) data and raising alerts for anomalies.

## 📌 Problem Statement

The Central Ground Water Board (CGWB) is deploying **14,000 Digital Water Level Recorders (DWLRs)** to monitor groundwater levels.  
Each DWLR records **4 water level data points per day**, generating a vast amount of data.  
Analyzing this manually is inefficient, so an automated system is required.

## 💡 Solution

This software automatically detects anomalies such as:
- 📉 Extremely low water levels
- ❌ Faulty DWLRs (no data recorded)

When anomalies are found, **SMS alerts** 📩 are sent to the concerned officers.

## 🚀 Features
✅ **Anomaly Detection** – Identifies abnormal groundwater levels.  
✅ **Alert System** – Sends SMS notifications to officers.  
✅ **Interactive Map** – Visual representation of water levels.  
✅ **Dataset Switching** – Load different test datasets.  
✅ **REST API** – Fetch alerts and map data programmatically.  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js
- **Frontend:** EJS, HTML, CSS
- **Database:** JSON-based dataset
- **Maps:** MapLibre, MapTiler SDK
- **SMS Alerts:** Twilio API
